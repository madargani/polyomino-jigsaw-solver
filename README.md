# Polyomino Jigsaw Puzzle

This Christmas I was gifted the [Aztec Labrinth puzzle](https://www.amazon.com/Bending-Wooden-Labyrinth-Difficult-Puzzles/dp/B08DDFNGV6) by Woodster.

Inspired by day 12 of [Advent of Code 2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025), I decided to make a solver for this puzzle.

## Usage

### Running the Application

You can run the Solver using either method:

**Using Python module execution:**

```bash
python -m polyomino_jigsaw_solver
```

**Direct script execution (from project root):**

```bash
python src/polyomino_jigsaw_solver/__main__.py
```

### Application Overview

The solver provides a GUI interface with two main tabs:

1. **Pieces Tab**: Define and manage puzzle pieces
2. **Board Tab**: Define the puzzle board grid

After defining the pieces and the board press solve and watch the solver solve your puzzle.
